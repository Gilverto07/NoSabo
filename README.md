# Overview
This project is a React-based web application that allows users to search for songs, view lyrics, and translate them. It uses multiple APIs such as the Genius API for song lyrics and searches, and the OpenAI API for translation. The app uses Netlify serverless functions to manage API requests securely. The main target audience is the "No Sabos" who like music in Spanish, but don't fully understand the lyrics, translate from Spanish to English, and vice-versa.

# Features
* Search for songs using a simple search bar with auto-suggestions
* Fetch lyrics of songs
* Translate lyrics directly within the app (powered by ChatGPT)
